# Data-Analysis
Collection of python and ipynb scripts used for data analysis

# align behavior and imaging
  - Align collected behavioral data of mouse to neuron calcium imaging data
  - Compared to original data analysis, mine uses floating point zeroes as opposed to integer zeroes.
  - Data will also appear as repeating decimals rather i.e. 1.2999 vs 1.3.
  
# CNMFE
  - Jupyter NB script that uses the CaImAn package to perform CNMFE analysis on imaging data that has already been pre processed by Inscopix software.
